# Book-bot

BookBot ->
  "You'll build a real command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein". 
  You'll be guided through the set up of a professional development environment using VS Code, Git, and Github. 
  This is the perfect first Python project for beginners."

  Courtesy of Boot.dev, this is a guided project, and I fully agree with the statement that it's a perfect first project, at least for me.
  I've been studying programming on and off for about two years now, and I have decided to take it more seriously from now on. 
  This mini-project was the perfect refresher regarding Python fundamentals. Adding Git and GitHub to the workflow was refreshing.

Things touched upon on while doing this project:
  - Basic workflow organisation
  - Project structure
  - Git + GitHub
  - Basic Data Structures
  - Loops and Conditional Statements
  - Lambda Functions
  - Function Definitions and Modularity
  - Formatting
  - String Manipulation
  - File Handling

This was a phenomenal starting point, and I would love to return later, after upgrading my knowledge,
to see how much more I can enhance this project.

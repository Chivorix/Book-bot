# Book-bot

BookBot ->
  "You'll build a real command-line application in Python that does static analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein". 
  You'll be guided through the set up of a professional development environment using VS Code, Git, and Github. 
  This is the perfect first Python project for beginners."

  Curtesy of Boot.dev , as said it is a guided project and i agree fully on the statement that it's a perfect first project,at least for me.
  I've been studying programming on/off for about 2 years now and have decided to take it more seriosly from now on,this mini-project was the perfect refresher
  regarding python fundamentals,adding git + github to the work flow was refrashing...
